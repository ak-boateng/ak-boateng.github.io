In this project I designed the user interaface and trained the model using collabrative filtering. Additionally, I designed the algorithm for the model to get the user input and display the results based on their preferences which is captured in the methodology of the work [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r9ufHXz6Vz5IHYDRJ2RYfthpLJWXLmRVtb-NHpBJF3U/edit?usp=sharing). The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/raphaelgogo/Tour_Safe.git).
