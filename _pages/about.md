👨🏻‍💻 I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Cape Coast

🔬 My research interests span Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Database Systems—particularly how these areas intersect to create efficient, intelligent data systems.

📊 I'm exploring several directions: training and evaluating large language models, optimizing database systems for ML workloads, and applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems. My undergraduate work focused on NLP pipelines and ML-based forecasting, and I'm currently deepening my foundations through Google's AI Research course.

🎯 I'm actively seeking M.Sc. opportunities in Computer Science where I can contribute to research in ML systems, NLP, computational optimization, or sustainable AI—and I'm excited to discover where my interests solidify through graduate research.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Computer Science and academia.

Welcome to my professional portfolio, showcasing my expertise in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning (ML). This portfolio highlights my education, work experience, projects, achievements, and skills, demonstrating my readiness for advanced opportunities in data science, machine learning research, and education.

# Selected Experience
## 🤖 Open Source & Research Contributions

I developed a Tourist Sites Recommendation System as my final project, integrating a full-stack application with a Machine Learning (ML) solution to provide personalized travel suggestions. Additionally, I contributed to AI model training at Invisible Technologies, specializing in Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-Tuning to improve model accuracy and ethical compliance.
## 📜 Practical Implementations & Freelancing

As the founder of Trace Digital Hub, I designed and deployed over 10 custom WordPress websites, leveraging CMS tools and frontend technologies (React, JavaScript) to enhance clients’ digital presence. My freelancing experience also includes building practical tools like a Blood Bank Management System (React) and an Inventory Management System (JavaFX), demonstrating my ability to translate theory into real-world solutions.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Professional Experience

  - **Advanced AI Data Trainer at Invisible Technologies (2024–Present):**
  Trained and fine-tuned AI models using Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning, optimizing decision-making and reducing error rates. Conducted quality analysis to ensure ethical AI standards.

  - **Teaching Assistant at University of Cape Coast (2024–Present):**
  Led tutorials for 300+ students in Database Management Systems, designing assessments and providing feedback to bridge learning gaps.

## 📚 Teaching & Community Engagement

I actively share my expertise in Computer Science and freelancing through my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@ameseseboateng), where I create tutorials, and share resources. As a Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Core Team Member, I facilitated workshops and meetups to empower student developers. My volunteer work includes training 20+ young adults in IT skills (Microsoft Office, typing) and providing technical support for community initiatives. I am also contributing to STEM Education by volunteering at Ghana Robotics Competition 2024 & 2025 by [FireflyIO](https://fireflyio.com/).
